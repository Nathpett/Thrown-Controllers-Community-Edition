# Thrown-Controllers-Community-Edition
Gonna learn how to use github.  Let's see what happens

I removed all MP3 and OGG from git, this will probably break the game when you try to run a scene with the removed music.  
I decided not to host music here just in case because I'm paranoid.  Solution would be to find the right music to replace the ones removed, or just remove the reference to the music in the editor


TODO
NEXT:
Overhaul how trivia is selected, or all of trivia structure??  pave way to enter devil state.  
add devil state (having chosen devil deal)

LATER:
Pick your poison
choose your destiny


MUCH LATER:
Day at the races:
  Three members of the audience are called up to total four players.
  each player -- starting with the contestant -- picks one of four characters to bet on winning a race.  
  only player per character.
  The only determining factor for winning is just that character's speed stat in game.  
  If an audience member wins, they become a contestant
  
  This can be procedurally trivia'ed as well.  Can implement an avatar class similar to the exisiting one using -- say -- all the pokemon sprites from HG/SS.
  Then draw in all the stats from pokemon (or, just their speed) to work on.
  Will need to be able to query up to 4 pokemon wihin a narrow range, that way we won't see... say, SlowPoke vs SlowBro vs Metapod vs Rapidash
  Will also need to forbid querying two pokemon with the same speed!!

A unique transition for each question!
