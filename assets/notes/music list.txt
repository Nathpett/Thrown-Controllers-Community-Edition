Special Thanks

Billy Raymond, BlueCrossSkye and Kandriod

These three YouTubers have added some of these songs in their playlists (just search "Thrown Controllers music" on YouTube and you find those three playlists which contain some of these songs I've listed)

Needless to say, their playlists helped me to get into good start when making this list

ProtonJon

Jon revealed me what music he used in categories Who the Heck is That?, Leap of Faith and Choose Your Destiny.

These three categories at that point were only categories where I didn't know, what theme he uses. So after he told me what songs he uses in these categories, my job on making this list was complete.

 

But anyway, let's get to the actual list of songs and music effects used in Thrown Controllers.
